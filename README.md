* According to the following image there have been some differences noticed in terms of the city type. Cities in rural area has significant lower number of Drivers comparing to Urban and Suburban. Since they have lower number of drivers there number of rides also very lower than the other type of cities. However there average fare per ride and average fare per driver are higher than the other type of cities and significant lower than the Urban averages. 

* It is noticable that cities in Urban areas have higher number of drivers but their number of rides comparing to the number of drivers are very low. This causes the significant decrease in average fare per ride and the average fare per driver. 

* Cities in Suburban areas shows their average fare per ride and average fare per driver between the averages of Urban and Rural areas. The number of drivers and the rides are higher than rural areas and lower than urban areas.
